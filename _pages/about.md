Hello! I am Anusheela, currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Argonne National Laboratory.
My research focuses on ...

Prior to this, I completed my PhD from the Northwestern University.<br>

When I am not thinking about X rays, I like to paint, sculpt clay figures, or solve (unnecessarily large) jigsaw puzzles. I also spent a significant chunk of my free time watching Chess on YouTube.
